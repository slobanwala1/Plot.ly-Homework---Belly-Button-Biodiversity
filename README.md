# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/bacteria.jpg)


In this homework we used d3 to traverse through JSON data,
store it in tables, display it in charts, and finally manipulate
a object to show the value of the frequency.

The most difficult portion of this homework has to be the advanced part where we have to create the gauge.
It took me a while to relax the math adds up to a half circle and that we can split each interval as if
we're going through a half circle. Then after that I had to relearn radius and get the math right. Another thing that
was a little frustrating in the starting was reading through the JSON because theirs so much data before you can make
one and two of each field in the objects. Once you can parse through one object, the other objects start to fall in piece.
I started off with populating the dropdown as if I can get the belly button ids to populate then I can start connecting the
pieces from there. After I was able to parse and get the names/ids I knew how to parse the outer object of objects and then
from there it was grabbing the object whose id matched the one that was selected in the "Test Subject ID No..". The bar graph
wasn't too bad as the values were ordered in descending order, I just grabbed the first 10 and reversed them since its horizontal.
For bubble graph just grab all the data and plot it and for the demographics data, I had to mess with the header and style tag to
make it bold and stay properly in the table. Had to go look at an older activity for that. I already talked about the advanced portion
which was the most time consuming but honestly, this was a really interesting homework and made me think outside of the box a lot more than
the others. Thanks for the opportunity!
